    <p class="b">My name is Flaka.Currently I am part of a bootcamp at Grand Circus for C#.Net.Previously I have worked as a NOC Tech at USSignal. My primary duties were using CTC to create circuitry 
       and test it. Additionally, I identified, fixed and reported all issues withing companys network.The reason why I want to be a developer is that I want to use my knowledge to build 
       more creative solutions.Also, working as a developer is more interactive and less automated.  At Grand Circus, I have been working in a few short projects due weekly. Also, will work 
       there is real life group project at the end of the bootcamp that will prepare me for real world challenges </p>
